# Biography

I am currently a project coordinator at [Mirai Technologies](http://mirai.co.id). We are essentially a software house that focuses on mobile applications catered towards startups. I manage 4 teams; iOS, Android, Hybrid, and Backend (plus a UI/UX designer).  In this capacity, 

- I serve as a communication bridge between clients and my teams. 
- I plan, prioritize, delegate projects’ features and tasks through an established and agreed timeline. 
- I coach and empower my teams so that they consistently are on top of their games.

In addition, prior to project management, I spent time in coding my personal Swift-based projects hosted at [Github](http://github.com/macgeekpro) and participating in open source projects there. I also had the privilege to serve as a teaching assistant in teaching Beginning iOS Development class at [Universitas Multimedia Nusantara](http://umn.ac.id), being responsible, among other things, for creating the in-class project for students to learn from.

I also had experiences in sales and marketing for a broadband infrastructure firm and consumer electronic goods and services company where I deal directly with potential clients on a daily basis addressing their potential needs or concerns, find and close sales leads, and work with other sales leaders to achieve targets for the companies. 

Here's my [CV](http://visualcv.com/yohannes). Should you have any question, please don’t hesitate to contact me for open discussion. 

Thanks for looking and have a great day.
